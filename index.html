          - Pig game is a 2 player dice game, both playing in rounds<br>
          - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wants, and each result gets added to the player's ROUND SCORE<br>
          - If the player rolls a 1, it loses its turn and all its ROUND SCORE<br>
          - In case the player chooses to 'HOLD', his ROUND SCORE gets added to its TOTAL SCORE and the player gives over its turn<br>
          - If the player rolls two back to back 6s, it loses its turn and all its TOTAL SCORE<br>
          - The default winning score is 100, which can be changed from the menu<br>
          - The first player to get 100 TOTAL SCORE wins the game.
